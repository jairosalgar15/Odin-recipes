  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This kale soup recipe is exactly what I am craving these days: comfort food + tons of veggies, all rolled into one. Its creamy broth (which, by the way, is thickened with blended white beans, not heavy cream) is swimming with tender kale and aromatics like onions, carrots, and celery. Rosemary and thyme add piney flavor, and a squeeze of lemon juice gives it the perfect bright finish. If you are looking for a dish that is equal parts cozy, healthy, and delicious, look no further. This kale soup is it!</p>
